### How to add/update links?
This is damn easy, man! Just do it!
- Fork this repo
- Open the file /redirect/routes.php
- Make your updates in the $routes routing rules array
- Commit and push your changes to your fork
- Open a pull request via GitHub

##### And then? :scream:
- After we merged it, the changes get automagically deployed via a webhook
- The list on the frontpage (tum.sexy) updates automagically as well :sunglasses:

*Hint: to display an item on the frontpage add it's key to the $sections array*

### Badass RULES everyone has to follow
- **what to add?** Everything that is not misleading. DO: propra35.tum.sexy, which targets the website of the Tutor√ºbung Group 35. **DON'T** propra.tum.sexy targeting that specific group page.
- **what to hide from frontage?** Everything that does not affect more than a few people.
